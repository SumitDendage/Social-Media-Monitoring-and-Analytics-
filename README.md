- Data Collection: Collect social media data using APIs and web scraping techniques from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

- Data Storage:Utilize a Hadoop-based data lake for raw and processed data storage. Use a NoSQL database for fast and flexible data querying.

- Data Processing and Analysis: Implement sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and influencer identification using machine learning algorithms.

- Data Visualization:Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize data trends, sentiment analysis, topic modeling results, and influencer insights.

- Reporting: Compile actionable insights and recommendations into a comprehensive report
Framework:
- Data Ingestion:
  - Social media data is collected through APIs and web scraping tools.
  - Data is ingested into a Hadoop-based data lake for further processing.
  
- Data Processing:
  - Data is cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using Python and Apache Spark.
  - Machine learning models for sentiment analysis and topic modeling are developed using libraries like scikit-learn
  
- Data Storage:
  - Processed data is stored in a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for efficient querying and retrieval.

- Data Visualization:
  - Data is visualized using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  - An interactive dashboard is developed to explore insights.

- Reporting
  - The final insights are compiled into a comprehensive report, providing actionable recommendations.


Big Data Analytics Utilization:
-  Sentiment Analysis:
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to analyze the sentiment of social media posts. This helps understand public opinion and emotional tone around specific topics, brands, or events.
  
- Topic Modeling:
  - Machine learning algorithms are used to identify key themes and topics discussed across social media platforms. This helps in recognizing trending subjects and areas of interest within large datasets.
  
- Influencer Identification:
  - Engagement metrics and influencer scores are calculated to identify key influencers within a social media network. This helps in targeting individuals who have significant reach and impact within their communities.
  
- Predictive Analytics:
  - Predictive models may be developed to forecast trends based on historical data, enabling proactive decision-making.


Deliverables:
- Processed Data Lake: A Hadoop-based repository containing collected and processed social media data.

- NoSQL Database: A MongoDB instance storing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data for fast querying.

- Sentiment Analysis Model: A machine learning model that provides sentiment analysis of social media content.

- Topic Modeling Results: Identification of key themes and topics across social media platforms.

- Influencer Identification List: A list of key influencers ranked by engagement metrics and influence scores.

- Interactive Dashboard: A dashboard providing stakeholders with visual insights into social media trends, sentiment, and influencer data.

- Insights and Recommendations Report:A detailed report with actionable insights and strategic recommendations 


Outcome:
The project will deliver a comprehensive Big Data analytics system that provides deep insights into social media trends, public sentiment, and key influencers. Users will benefit from a user-friendly interactive dashboard and a detailed report, enabling informed decision-making based on real-time social media data. The insights derived from this system can be used to shape marketing strategies, public relations efforts, and overall business strategies, ensuring a proactive approach to managing online presence and engagement.
